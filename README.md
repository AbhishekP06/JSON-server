# TECH.GEEK React Project - JSON Server

Welcome to the TECH.GEEK React project! This repository contains the JSON server setup and the associated `db.json` file.

## About the Project

The TECH.GEEK React project is a simple wiki-like web page showcasing information about top tech people! This React project provides a user-friendly interface to browse and explore details of influential individuals in the technology industry.. The JSON server and `db.json` file are utilized to simulate a backend API and provide a data source for the React application.

## JSON Server

The JSON server is a lightweight tool that allows us to create a mock RESTful API using a JSON file as the data source.


## Modifying the `db.json` File

To make changes to the data in the `db.json` file, open the file in your preferred text editor and modify the JSON structure according to your requirements.
